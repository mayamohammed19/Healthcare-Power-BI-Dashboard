# Healthcare-Power-BI-Dashboard
This project demonstrates the ability to analyze healthcare data and present meaningful insights using Power BI. The dashboard focuses on hospital operations, patient demographics, admission trends, billing analysis, and length of stay metrics.

Dataset Source
Kaggle – Healthcare Dataset by prasad22. The dataset contains synthetic but realistic hospital
admission records, billing data, patient demographics, and medical conditions.


Data Preparation & Cleaning
• Removed non-analytical columns such as Doctor Name and Room Number.
• Converted admission and discharge columns to Date data type.
• Created a calculated column for Length of Stay.
• Created Age Groups to enable demographic analysis.
• Validated numeric fields such as Age and Billing Amount.

Key KPIs
• Total Patients
• Average Length of Stay
• Total Billing Amount
• Average Billing Amount
• Emergency Admission Percentage

Dashboard Visuals
• Admissions trend over time
• Patients by medical condition
• Billing amount by medical condition
• Average length of stay by admission type
• Patient distribution by age group and gender


Filters & Interactivity
Interactive slicers were added for Hospital, Medical Condition, Admission Type, Insurance Provider,
and Gender. All KPIs and visuals dynamically update based on user selections.

Key Insights
• Emergency admissions represent a significant portion of total patient inflow.
• Certain medical conditions contribute disproportionately to total billing.
• Length of stay varies significantly by admission type.
• Senior age groups tend to have longer hospital stays.

This dashboard highlights skills in data transformation, DAX calculations, KPI development,
healthcare analytics, and executive-level dashboard design using Power BI.
